# PRBS
# Pseudo Random Number Generation Using Linear Feedback Shift Registers
## LFSR 
a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.

## Function:
1) PRBS Monitor generates LFSR given the pattern generated by PRBS Generator.
2) Lock is set to 1 when Gen and Monitor have the same pattern value.
3) Bit_error is set to high when Gen and Monitor sync for 3 consecutive cycles.
